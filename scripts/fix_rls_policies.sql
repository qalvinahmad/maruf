-- Fix RLS policies for teacher_profiles table
-- This script will drop existing problematic policies and create proper ones

-- First, check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('teacher_profiles', 'teacher_verifications');

-- Drop existing policies if they exist (ignore errors if they don't exist)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON teacher_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON teacher_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on email" ON teacher_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for users based on email" ON teacher_profiles;

-- Drop existing policies for teacher_verifications
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON teacher_verifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON teacher_verifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for authenticated users" ON teacher_verifications;

-- Temporarily disable RLS to allow operations
ALTER TABLE teacher_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE teacher_verifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- OR create more permissive policies if you want to keep RLS enabled
-- Uncomment the following section if you prefer to keep RLS:

/*
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE teacher_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE teacher_verifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create permissive policies for teacher_profiles
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read teacher_profiles" 
ON teacher_profiles FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated 
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert teacher_profiles" 
ON teacher_profiles FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update teacher_profiles" 
ON teacher_profiles FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create permissive policies for teacher_verifications
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read teacher_verifications" 
ON teacher_verifications FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated 
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert teacher_verifications" 
ON teacher_verifications FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update teacher_verifications" 
ON teacher_verifications FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);
